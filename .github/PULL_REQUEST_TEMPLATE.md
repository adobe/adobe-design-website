## Browser Testing
We should aim to support the latest version of the listed browsers. For older versions or other browsers not on the list, content should be accessible, even if it doesn't completely match the designs.

Developers should test as they work in the browsers available on their machines. If they have access to other devices to test other browser/OS combinations, they should do that when possible.
